# HILO-MPC examples

This is the repository containing some example application examples of HILO-MPC in .py format and Jupyter notebooks.

## Instructions
To run the examples is sufficient to have installed HILO-MPC. See the HILO-MPC documentation for instruction on the 
installation. Some examples require other packages, such as Bokeh or matplotlib (for plotting) and PyTorch and Tensorboard for 
training neural networks and visualizing the learning statistic, respectively.

## Feedback
We will be very happy to receive your feedback on the example and on the toolbox itself. 
Please feel free to contact the developers directly or to write an issue in GitHub.
